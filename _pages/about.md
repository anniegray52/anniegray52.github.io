I'm a PhD student at the Centre for Doctoral Training in Computational Statistics and Data Science at the University of Bristol, supervised by Professor Patrick Rubin-Delanchy and Professor Nick Whiteley.

My research consists of providing a statistical grounding for manifold structure in high-dimensional data and to demonstrate that rich topological and geometric structure can emerge from generic and simple statistical assumptions involving correlations and latent variables. The aim of this work is to shed light on the efficacy of PCA for reduction from high to moderate dimensions before clustering, topological data analysis, nonlinear dimension reduction, regression and classification. This lead to work which gives insights to recover hidden tree structure in data via hierarchical clustering with dot products.

I have also created python package: [pyemb](https://github.com/pyemb/pyemb). With tools to perform exploratory data anaylsis for complex data such as embedding, clustering and visualisation.

Other projects
====== 

During a collaboration with Microsoft Research Special Projects, working in [Human Rights Technology](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/human-rights-technology/), I have been involved in developing and implementing techniques for detecting and understanding risk from relationships in large-scale datasets. One application for this work is to identify corruption in public procurement data using multiple data sources that describe relationships between companies. 

I have also worked on a project with the [Smith Institute](https://www.smithinst.co.uk/), where I researched social network resilience to misinformation. My work here explored techniques that can be used to prevent misinformation spread, including education, algorithmic changes, red-teaming and regulation.
